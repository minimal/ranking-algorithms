Data Science London Talk

* The problem
  * Felt that the team winning the Champions League wasn't necessarily
    the best team - think Mourinho said it's heavily luck based
  * UEFA coefficients rank over 5 years and don't take into account
    the strength of the opposition
* Getting data - not easily available anywhere - scrape it using Enlive
  * Show the ability to explore the HTML using Chrome inspector &
    nrepl
  * Show how you can redefine functions in nrepl (Ctrl X + E) so you
    can try out new ways of scraping the data

* Implementing algorithm and testing it out with fake values in nrepl
* Gluing it all together with the Elo algorithm
  * Elo algorithm is simple to implement - favours the teams that won
    more matches in total, doesn't take the round into account e.g. you
    end up with Juventus as the 5th strongest team despite winning the
    Champions League
  * Documented problems with Elo:
    1. New players can take a long time to ascend or descend to their correct levels.
    2. Highly ranked players can be hesitant to play with provisional
       players whose ranking might be much more uncertain.
    3. There are no allowances for games with more than two players.
